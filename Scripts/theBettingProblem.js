/*
A friend of yours want to place a bet. He wants to bet on the outcome of 8 different football matches.
In order to win, your friend needs to guess the result of at least 6 of the 8 matches.
That means that he has to place a different bet for all different half-dozen combinations.
The same applies for the 'seven' combinations.

Calculate how many different bets your friend has to place, and how much money he has to put in every bet if his whole betting budget is 100$.
Use functions to make this part re-usable.
